2.Keeping the system up-to-date with security patches and updates

Keeping the system up-to-date with security patches and updates is vital for system security. Security patches address known vulnerabilities, and updates improve software performance.To effectively keep your system up-to-date with security patches enable automatic updates and prioritize critical updates, regularly check for security advisories, keep backups, test updates, and follow security best practices.Shortcomings in keeping the system up-to-date with security patches and updates may include compatibility issues, testing challenges, human error.You have to change the operating system in order to get alternate.

3.Configuring and using a firewall to control network traffic

Configuring and using a firewall to control network traffic is a fundamental practice.Firewalls are network security devices that filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules. There are different types of firewalls, including network-based, host-based, and cloud-based firewalls.Firewall configuration involves defining rules to allow or deny traffic based on criteria such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and application types.To effectively use firewalls, define clear policies, regularly update rules, follow the principle of least privilege, keep software/firmware up-to-date, monitor logs.Firewall shortcomings include reliance on signature-based detection,challenges with encrypted traffic, and complexity in management.
